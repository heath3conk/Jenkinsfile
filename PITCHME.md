### Benefits of using a Jenkinsfile
 1. Easier to move to a new Jenkins instance
    * Which we will all have to do at the end of Q2 (~June)
 2. Version Control    
 3. Easier to see logic hidden behind each job
 4. Portability
    * Get up and running quickly when you move to a new team
 5. Supports more complexity (because it's groovy code)
    * Try/Catch blocks, functions, etc.

### Tips and Tricks
  1. Name your Jenkinsfile with the .groovy ending so IntelliJ highlights and assists you
  2. Let Gradle do the heavy lifting
    * Gradle has many plugins that allow tasks, such as adding your deployable artifact or pushing your app to Cloud Foundry, to be run simply by providing the config info to the plugin
    * Allows for a clean pipeline
